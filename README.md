The program is done under the requirement of LBYARCHâ€™s MP2 with the following specs:

## The C Program

The C program allows the calling of both C and assembly kernels. The C program also tracks both the average time and number of execution of each kernel. The value for both vectors is simply a repetition of 0-100 repeatedly until the whole vector is filled out. The sanity check done to see the correctness of both the C and assembly program is if both programs have the same answer. The average time is calculated by executing each kernel 30 times.

## Kernel Comparison and Analysis

The assembly kernel is clearly faster than the C kernel where the speed difference ranges between 1-5%. But as the input size grows exponentially, the difference in average speed between the two kernels becomes insignificant. 

The tests where done with vector sizes 2^20, 2^24, and 2^26. Vector sizes beyond 2^26 are unfeasible due to the computer device lagging and crashing with it.
